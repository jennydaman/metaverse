                      Technology has long connected people when they cannot physically be together - even before the coronavirus pandemic brought about an increased use of Zoom and other video conferencing platforms. As is human nature, only when it was taken away did people realize the value of person to person interactions, which bolstered enthusiasm for technological alternatives.

                      A fully realized metaverse could allow people to interact in an immersive, computer-generated environment that feels real. Some experts believe engaging in interpersonal relationships, from significant others to workplace colleagues, could become commonplace in the metaverse. Family and friends who live miles away from each other could meet in the metaverse and wholly interact as if they were right next to each other, instead of settling for a 2D video call.

                      “When [Meta Platforms] talks about the metaverse, they talk about it as a unified social, virtual world where everybody can meet and interact,” said Andrea Stevenson Won, director of the Virtual Embodiment Lab at Cornell University. When Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms, even more people associated the metaverse with its social potential. “But what that leaves out is there are already a lot of different social, virtual worlds in which people have been having important social interactions and building community for decades.”

                      There is a long way to go before an interoperable metaverse - where multiple virtual worlds are seamlessly connected - exists. Right now, as Won says, “You can’t, for example, set up your avatar in Second Life and then take it over and play with it in Minecraft and then use it to connect with your relatives through Facebook.” But individual virtual communities owned by select companies - each requiring different engagements with technology - are not new.

                      Founded in 2003, “Second Life” was one of the first mainstream virtual worlds, primarily created for socializing. Users create avatars to interact with other users and user-created content. Together, they can attend social gatherings, from concerts to college classes. “Second Life” does not require a headset. AltspaceVR, on the other hand, can be accessed through a computer or a virtual reality headset. Founded in 2013, it expands on “Second Life.” Organizations host live events and gatherings on the platform for people to attend virtually. Their tagline, “Be together, anywhere,” sums up the appeal of many of these platforms.

                      Many virtual reality platforms rely on avatars to facilitate user interaction and engagement. Avatars are a virtual manifestation of the user and the “being” they become to interact with virtual worlds, including other users in those worlds. Different platforms allow for different levels of customization, but typically users can design their avatar to accurately reflect their own physicality or be something completely different.

                      Some headsets and hand controllers used in extended reality can even mimic the gestures and facial expressions of the user onto their avatar, making a more believable interaction. According to Gartner, a technology research and consulting company based in Connecticut, 25% of people will be spending at least one hour per day in the metaverse, by 2026. Customizable avatars as the virtual rendition of the user become all the more important.

                      “Avatars tend to be cartoony and goofy,” said Won, who is also a professor of communication at Cornell University. “But [when] you see someone you know well and you recognize their gestures and it matches up with their voice and their mannerisms, even filtering through the virtual reality experience, it’s like, ‘Oh, hey. This is my buddy,’ which is a really remarkable achievement. So, if that were someone you couldn’t see, [who] you’re normally seeing through a Zoom screen or on a phone, it is in some ways a richer experience. You can do more things together, you feel more like you’re with people you care about.”

                      Engaging with other people through avatars in a virtual world holds importance for several communities but there is unique value for those who have physical disabilities. Thomas Logan, an accessibility expert, is passionate about working with extended reality companies to make sure their technology is inclusive toward people with physical, cognitive or other disabilities. For example, extended reality often requires people to physically move about in a space, which can be a barrier for people in wheelchairs. It is also not as easy to add closed captions in extended reality, which would impact people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

                      There is still room for improvement, but Logan says extended reality can also specifically help people with physical disabilities, because they can create avatars that don’t necessarily need to mirror the physical disabilities they have in the real world. If their physical disability impacts how they are perceived in the real world, they can be perceived differently in the virtual world.

                      “Being able to represent yourself exactly how you appear in the real world is one thing I believe should be supported and allowed in the technologies,” said Logan, who founded Equal Entry, a global technology accessibility consulting company. “For some people, that’s their point of view and they want that. They’re like, ‘Hey, if I use a guide dog in the real world, I want to have a guide dog in [virtual reality].’ But [there’s] the other idea too, that you can present yourself any way that you want…you don’t know that [they] have a disability because they appear as however [they] choose to appear. That’s going even further into having people realize it’s just a physical limitation and not anything that affects cognition or actually who the person is on the inside.”

                      There is, of course, a danger to that experience. Depending on the degree of difference between a person’s real world physical appearance and their avatars, they can become disconnected from their real world identity in a way that impacts their self and public perception. But Logan agrees the reprieve gained - even temporarily - from something as simple as a custom avatar is special.

                      The detailed visualization of avatars means extended reality may not only facilitate human interaction but enhance it, in terms of both accessibility and quality. Educational institutions and the workplace are two of the biggest environments for socializing. For a long time, emphasis was placed on in-person interactions, but the coronavirus pandemic made remote engagement not only a feasible alternative but a tool for expanding innovation and collaboration.

                      “Can we use virtual reality to improve our interactions with other people?” said Won. “When you’re dealing with people [who] you don’t know well or maybe even meeting for the first time if they’re remote…having that interaction in immersive virtual reality could potentially smooth that process of getting to know each other that might be more awkward on Zoom or on a phone call. There’s potential in tweaking these embodied interactions that could make people learn to get along and know each other better.”

                      For that reason, education and workplaces are both growing industries for extended reality. According to Fortune Business Insights, a market research company based in India, the global virtual reality in education market was worth approximately $656.6 million in 2018, with an expected compound annual growth rate of 42.9% from 2019 to 2026, projecting approximately $13098.2 million.

                      Eileen McGivney is a PhD candidate at Harvard University whose work focuses on how people learn in immersive, computer-generated environments. For example, she partnered with a high school science teacher to coordinate virtual reality field trips to Antarctica and the International Space Station. She observed how the students interacted with each other in these experiences.

                      “It was very clear [the students] wanted this to be a shared experience with other people,” said McGivney. “Sometimes, they were talking to each other while they had the headsets on. They [were] in a big area where everybody has their own space, but they [could] all hear each other. They would shout, like, ‘Yo, I’m climbing this wall, I’m about to fall!’ They would ask each other what they were doing. When they took the headsets off and we gave them a written activity to do, it totally sucked the life out of the room.”

                      Especially in classrooms, this technology could level the playing field in terms of the students who are more likely than others to engage in the classroom.

                      “Does it make it easier for shy people to speak up when they [can] hide a little bit behind an avatar, does it even out people’s willingness to talk?” said Won. “Does it make it easier to have hard discussions? Are there ways in which, at least for some people, interacting in virtual spaces might be better at first? Then, we can think about [whether it is] possible to use these experiences that are more exciting or more engaging or feel a little more comfortable for people who are shy, can we use those experiences and then take them back to the classroom and improve our overall in-person classroom dynamics?”

                      Still, few people believe social experiences in the metaverse, even if fully realized, will completely replace in-person experiences - despite its potential to do so. Especially for younger people, considering K-12 educational experiences and early career beginnings, the value of in-person experiences has been proven.

                      But the similarities between extended reality platforms and social media platforms are strong, which begs concerns about an addiction to extended reality the same way social media addiction is a continuous problem. Just like social media, people can create and interact as versions of themselves that don’t necessarily represent who they really are, they can live and observe lives that are not necessarily accurately reflective of the real world, leading to an altered sense of reality and identity - only heightened by the immersive environment.

                      “We need to think, always, about how experiences in virtual reality can enhance our experiences in the physical world and not how they can replace them,” said Won. “When people talk about, ‘You can do everything you do in real life in the metaverse,’ that’s fine. But it would be a very sad world if we were spending 10 hours a day in a headset. I think that would be terrible.”

              The fantasticalness of the gaming world led easily into the fantasticalness of the metaverse.
              Many early iterations of metaverse environments were created in the context of gaming, specifically
              video games, where the concept of creating an avatar to interact with other users in a digitally-designed
              world was common enough.

                      The immersive, computer-generated world of the metaverse lends itself well to the fantastical nature of gaming. People venture into video games to experience what they cannot in real life, like fighting off zombies during an apocalypse or adventurous space travel. That is also why many people primarily associate the metaverse with gaming, especially video games where the concept of creating an avatar to interact with users in a virtual world was common enough.

                      Gaming in extended reality has evolved to not only include creative leniencies but digital commerce and social interaction. In recent times, however, entertainment in metaverse environments has grown beyond typical video games to also encompass live events and other artistic ventures that bring people together in ways they could not otherwise do.

                      “As far as entertainment goes, entertainment makes an excellent driver,” said Dan Novy, professor of emerging media arts at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “It’s a really good forcing function for these kinds of things.”

                      Virtual reality games have only become more popular and their content runs the gamut. Created in 2019, “Beat Saber” is a rhythm game in a neon environment where users slice blocks representing musical beats with a pair of colored sabers. “L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files,” created in 2018, is a detective game. Users become Detective Cole Phelps in the game and solve crimes and conspiracies. Many of these games were adapted - either literally or conceptually - from 2D games commonly played on phones or computers.

                      Other popular virtual reality experiences include all kinds of sports. In 2021, Cody Woputz, an expert in virtual reality with experience at several different technology companies, founded ThrowbackVR, a social- and multiplayer-focused gaming platform that leveraged nostalgia.

                      “Throwback really started as sort of a gap in the market that my co-founder, Jordan, and I saw, which was that there’s not a lot of simple, nostalgic content in [virtual reality] right now,” said Woputz. “You look at some of the trends on TikTok and there were a lot of nostalgia-fueled communities. We took that and said, ‘Well, can we turn that into a 3D digital space, can we use the power of virtual reality?’”

                      Recently, they created a virtual reality baseball game called “Derby,” now available on SideQuestVR, a platform that supports virtual reality experiences in their early stages. As simple as it sounds, it is a baseball game in immersive reality that allows you to play the sport with people you may not physically be able to play the sport with, thereby prioritizing connection.

                      “I think what we’re trying to do is replicate [baseball] in virtual reality as something that is a little bit more slow, a little bit more casual and could let you play baseball in a way that, you know, I can’t in a homerun in real life, but I can in our game,” said Woputz. “So, that’s fun.”

                      What is relatively new, on the other hand, are the growing physical locations - all over the country - dedicated to these kinds of technology that people can visit to engage in virtual reality experiences. VR World NYC is a comprehensive virtual reality amusement center in Manhattan that offers different experiences in art, film and gaming. Sandbox VR is a similar national center, with locations in California, Indiana, Minnesota and elsewhere.

                      Boston’s Key to Amaze VR is one of those centers. Founded in 2019, Key to Amaze VR allows up to 12 people to assume avatars and simultaneously engage in a variety of virtual reality experiences in futuristic environments. From a competitive paintball-like game called “Tower Tag” to “OpenBrush,” which allows users to create all kinds of art, the center hopes to welcome people who may not have much experience with virtual reality into its boundless opportunities.

                      “We know this is something that is special, it’s not an individual experience,” said William Ferraro, CEO of Key to Amaze VR. “It can connect people, it’s a great way to connect people.”

                      Key to Amaze VR facilitates their virtual reality experiences with the HTC Vive Pro headsets, complete with spatial sound headphones, and accompanying wireless handheld controllers. The equipment creates a truly immersive experience compared to a 2D screen. For example, if a user was drawing a bow and arrow playing “Elvin Assassin,” not only does the headset put them right in the environment, but their controllers vibrate with tension as they pull the string back.

                      “You feel completely immersed in the experience to the point where we get a lot of people trying to lean on walls that aren’t really there, put their hands on banisters, things like that,” said Nate [LAST NAME], CTO of Key to Amaze VR. “We get people trying to run away from zombies. I’m not sure why it is, but there’s certain people that completely fall for it, completely believe the idea that there’s a zombie in front of you and you have to protect yourself. Some people are aware that it’s a different type of experience, and some people just completely believe it.”

                      Places like Key to Amaze VR will continue to hold over virtual reality experiences that people access from their homes that they have the space to easily facilitate the game. Many virtual reality experiences, although they require only a few pieces of technology, require a large amount of space to use, which is why they might not be as mainstream as 2D entertainment. Additionally, it is unlikely that people will enjoy wearing headsets for extended periods of time to engage in different experiences.

                      “I know a lot of my friends who were early, early adopters of this wave of virtual reality ended up like, “I’m going to get rid of all the furniture in my living room,” and basically they have this big bare space, because that’s what they need to do,” said Novy. “Most people are not going to be willing to do that. The claim with [virtual reality] or the metaverse is that you’re going to put on a headset or something and you’re going to have this infinite space. But in reality, you’re now requiring even more space. You want the experience to be as quick and comfortable and fluid as sitting down and turning on Netflix and finding something you want to watch.”

                      Of course, it is not all fun and games. Concerns about addictions to video games have been around for a long time and are only heightened in the context of immersive reality. Specifically, many of these games are targeted toward children, which increases risks of addiction.

                      “I think it’s like any other medium,” said Novy. “It’s going to require parental guidance. How much screen time do you allow your child, what do they learn while they’re in there? What are the experiences they’re allowed to [have]? As a parent, you’re going to be responsible for the experiences that your child could be having in these kinds of virtual spaces.”

                      Regardless of age, however, experts do believe an excessive exposure to virtual reality games can leave an impact on the users psychology. With the development of immersive technology, these are powerful mediums and experts emphasize the importance of staying connected to the real world.

                      “What it can lead to is alienation, disassociation and lack of empathy,” said Novy. “If you’re spending most of your time with virtual characters, you’re not learning to empathize with them, especially in some of the more violent games. It’s as important for artists creating these games to create experiences that also require empathy to win the game.”
