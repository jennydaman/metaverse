            The future of technological innovation. <br>
            The forthcoming iteration of the internet. <br>
            The next big thing.

            Chances are you have heard revolutionary statements as such - from flagship technology companies to your
            gamer friend - about a system that will change the world: the metaverse. Colloquially, it is a computer-generated,
            immersive world that people can navigate and interact with, designed to mimic the real world and beyond. The truth,
            however, is far more complex.

            Some people believe humans will be able to live - at least part of their lives - in the metaverse, working and
            socializing as they do in the real world but with more creative freedom and without the physical limitations.
            Despite the widespread reach of its spectacle, however, the metaverse itself remains enigmatic. Both expansive
            yet not fully realized, the metaverse raises many questions about its inner workings, inherent dangers and its
            all-encompassing future.

            “I like to say that the metaverse is a metaphor,” said David Nelson, director of the Mixed Reality Lab at the University of Southern California. “It is a placeholder for what we will do with immersive technology, how we will adopt it and how it will impact our lives and our culture. People are using this term without it really being defined yet and I think they know that because it is being defined as we discuss it.”

            It is hard to say what the metaverse is. But here is what the metaverse is not: it is not a conception nor a product of Meta Platforms. In 2021, when Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">rebranded</a> as Meta Platforms and announced its renewed focus on the metaverse, the futuristic system became popularly, solely and falsely associated with the social media company.

            <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/metaverse-market-report">According</a> to Grand View Research, a global market research and consulting company based in the United States and India, the global metaverse market was worth approximately $38.85 billion in 2021, with an expected compound annual growth rate of 39.4% from 2022 to 2030, projecting approximately $678.8 billion. Meta Platforms is one of several companies with a stake in the metaverse. And this is when the metaverse does not even exist yet.
          </p>

            “The most recent Mark Zuckerberg iteration of the metaverse is a half-assed update of a very, very, very old idea,” said Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

            The word “metaverse” made its first appearance in “Snow Crash,” a 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson, describing a digital world accessed through headsets. Metaverse ideas became mainstream fictional fodder, from movies like “The Matrix” about humans trapped within a simulated reality, released in 1999, to “Ready Player One” about humans escaping the real world to a virtual one, published as a book in 2011 and released as a movie in 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technology followed. 2003 saw the creation of “Second Life,” an online virtual world where people could interact as themselves or other custom beings in environments from a science laboratory to a movie theater. In 2014, Google released Google Cardboard, a cardboard viewer designed to fully cover the user’s eyes that simulates virtual reality through compatible mobile apps, followed by Facebook’s Oculus Quest, a wireless virtual reality headset, that is immersive and panoramic, primarily used for entertainment, in 2019.

          <p>
            Most likely, you have had some sort of interaction with some sort of iteration of the metaverse. But do you really understand what it is or what it could become?
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no consensual definition of the metaverse, but many point to Matthew Ball, author of the 2022 book, “The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything.” His definition reads, “A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of those keywords are already realized through existing technology. A “virtual world,” for example, is a computer-generated environment - like a violent warzone or a busy restaurant - commonly present across video games and animated movies, in both 3D and otherwise. Moreover, most people have experienced “synchronicity,” to some extent, by simultaneously interacting with other people through video conferencing platforms.
